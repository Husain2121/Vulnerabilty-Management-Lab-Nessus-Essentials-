# Enterprise Vulnerabilty Management Lab

📘 <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19muGDByoBYfV9OwJdZuN0kO2W2oBJB233-OgYFRHHGQ/edit?usp=sharing">Full Step-by-Step Tutorial Documentation</a>

<h2>Description</h2>
The project consists of a fully operational vulnerability management lab that was constructed on a PC using Nessus Essentials and VMware Workstation Player. The lab shows how to set up a Windows 10 virtual machine for enterprise-style risk assessments, uncredentialed and credentialed vulnerability scanning, and more. By purposefully introducing outdated software, evaluating scan results, and ranking findings according to severity, the environment mimics real-world security exposure. Uninstalling susceptible apps, installing system updates, and re-scanning to verify risk reduction are methods used to validate remediation. This project demonstrates fundamental vulnerability management concepts, such as asset assessment, credentialed scanning, vulnerability analysis, and remediation verification, in a realistic enterprise-style lab setting.
